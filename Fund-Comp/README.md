# Fundamentals of Computing 

This repository contains my coursework and laboratory assignments for the **Fundamentals of Computing** course at the **University of Notre Dame**.

The focus of this work is on low-level systems programming, memory management, and data structure implementation using **C** in a Linux environment.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
* **Languages:** C
* **Build System:** GNU Make (Makefiles)
* **Environment:** Linux / Unix Shell

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered
* **Memory Management:** Manual allocation/deallocation (`malloc`, `free`), pointers, and buffer handling.
* **Data Structures:** Implementation of Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees from scratch.
* **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, and recursion.
* **File I/O:** Parsing text streams and handling file pointers.

## ⭐ Featured Labs
*These projects represent the most significant engineering challenges in this course.*

### 1. Space Odyssey (Arcade Game) - Final Project
* **Challenge:** Engineered a real-time 2D survival game using a custom graphics library.
* **Key Concepts:** struct-based object management, collision detection algorithms (bounding box/radial), velocity vectors, and event-driven loops.
* **Why it matters:** Demonstrates the ability to manage complex state machines (Menu -> Game -> Game Over) and handle physics calculations in C.

### 2. Crossword Puzzle Generator
* **Challenge:** Developed an algorithm to parse a dictionary of words and arrange them into a valid 15x15 crossword grid.
* **Key Concepts:** 2D array manipulation, string parsing (`string.h`), file I/O operations, and placement logic to maximize word intersections.
* **Why it matters:** Shows proficiency in data processing and algorithmically solving constraint-based problems.

### 3. Recursive Fractals
* **Challenge:** Visualized mathematical patterns by implementing recursive drawing functions.
* **Key Concepts:** Recursion (Base cases vs. Recursive steps), trigonometry (`math.h`), and geometric coordinate transformation.
* **Output:** Generates Sierpinski triangles, Koch snowflakes, and Ferns based on user input.
